Dylan Terayama

Level 2 (Associate)

## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

I have a strong foundation in mathematics, having taken precalculus and AP Calculus AB in high school, and I have also been introduced to programming through a coding class. Additionally, I have a solid understanding of financial markets and stock market analysis, which I’ve applied as an individual investor. This interest in the financial world, combined with my academic background, sparked my interest in quantitative finance. I am currently focused on pursuing a degree in accounting and mathematics and am eager to further develop my skills in financial modeling and data analysis through the Alpha Program.

## 2. Career Goals

For now, I plan to focus on studying accounting and mathematics. I believe these areas will provide me with a strong foundation in both the financial and quantitative aspects of the business world. In the future, I aim to use my expertise in accounting and quantitative finance to contribute to my family business, ensuring long-term growth and financial stability. Over the next 1, 5, and 10 years, I aim to deepen my understanding of these fields and develop the skills necessary to make informed, data-driven financial decisions.

## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

Through the Alpha Program, I hope to strengthen my understanding of quantitative finance concepts, including financial modeling, risk assessment, and algorithmic trading. I want to improve my technical skills in programming (particularly in Python and R) and statistics, as these are essential for data-driven financial analysis. Additionally, I hope to gain exposure to tools and platforms commonly used in the finance industry, as well as networking opportunities that will help me connect with professionals and other students in the field.

## 4. Current Technical Skills

I have strong Excel skills and earned my Excel Associate certification earlier this year. I also have basic programming experience from my high school coding class and am currently working on improving my skills in Python and R. I have a basic understanding of financial modeling and data analysis, but I am looking to build upon these skills. I would rate myself as an intermediate user of Excel and a beginner in Python, R, and financial modeling.

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

During this program, I plan to improve my technical skills in Python and R, specifically in the context of financial analysis and modeling. I also want to strengthen my understanding of statistical methods as they relate to finance and risk management. I will measure my progress by applying what I’ve learned to hands-on projects and assignments. I plan to dedicate 8-10 hours each week to the program and will use additional resources such as online tutorials, finance books, and forums to supplement the materials. My definition of success for this program is being able to confidently apply the concepts learned to both my academic work and future career.
